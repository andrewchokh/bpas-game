## 3. Key Systems

### Game State Manager

- Global script (`GameState.gd`) tracks game state, such as free roam, cutscene, pause, game over, etc.

### Entity System

- Player, Enemy, Weapon, Projectile use different base class
- Each mechanic must be implemented with Component System that can be applied to any entity.
  - Example:
  ```
  PlayerCharacter.tscn
  â”œâ”€â”€ MovementComponent
  â”œâ”€â”€ HealthComponent
  â””â”€â”€ InventoryComponent
  ```
- Use signals for triggered effects, such as changed health, death, weapon switch, etc.

### Combat System

- Player can have up to three weapons that he can use and switch between
- Hitbox is a separate component (extends Area2D) that registrates hits. It does NOT have collision with other hitboxes

## 4. Code Style & Conventions

- [C# style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_style_guide.html) for code style
  - `snake_case` for directories
- Signals at top of script
- Keep logic modular (one responsibility per script). Use Component System when possible

## 5. Scene Organization Pattern

- Each major entity = 1 scene + 1 script
- No deeply nested nodes unless necessary
- Example:

```
Player.tscn
â”œâ”€â”€ Sprite2D
â”œâ”€â”€ CollisionShape2D
â””â”€â”€ Player.cs
```
